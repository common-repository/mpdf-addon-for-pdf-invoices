== Description ==
<pre>
<strong> NOTE: </strong>
This plugin is an add-on for <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/print-invoices-packing-slip-labels-for-woocommerce/">WooCommerce PDF Invoices, Packing Slips, Delivery Notes and Shipping Labels plugin</a> , <a href="https://www.webtoffee.com/product/woocommerce-gift-cards/">WebToffee WooCommerce Gift Cards plugin</a> and <a href="https://www.webtoffee.com/product/woocommerce-request-a-quote/">WebToffee WooCommerce Request a Quote plugin</a>.
</pre>

= Introduction =
mPDF addon is an extension for [WebToffee WooCommerce Gift Cards](https://www.webtoffee.com/product/woocommerce-gift-cards/), [WebToffee WooCommerce Request a Quote](https://www.webtoffee.com/product/woocommerce-request-a-quote/) and [WooCommerce PDF invoices, Packing Slips, Delivery Notes & Shipping labels plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/print-invoices-packing-slip-labels-for-woocommerce/).

This plugin replaces dompdf with another library that supports RTL and all other Unicode languages including Hebrew and Arabic adding a better RTL integration for PDF documents. It is equipped to handle almost 12 RTL languages including most Asian languages. The plugin also can be used with the WebToffee WooCommerce Gift Cards plugin to create gift cards in PDF format.

== Features ==
* RTL Support
* Support for all languages including Unicode standard
* Prints Hebrew and Arabic languages 
* Seamless integration with the WebToffee WooCommerce Gift cards, WebToffee WooCommerce Request a Quote and WooCommerce PDF Invoices, Packing Slips, Delivery Notes & Shipping Labels plugin by WebToffee
* Facilitates easy print, download, and attachment provisions.

&#9989; Tested OK with WooCommerce 9.3.0

== Why do you need the mPDF add-on? ==
The PDF converter library that we use (dompdf) in [WooCommerce PDF Invoice, Packings Slips, Delivery Notes & Shipping Labels](https://wordpress.org/plugins/print-invoices-packing-slip-labels-for-woocommerce/) plugin provides only partial support for RTL. In addition to this, Hebrew and Arabic characters are not supported by the font (Open Sans) that is used in the pre-defined templates. 

To overcome this, the mPDF add-on provisions another library (in addition to dompdf) to support RTL and also includes fonts that support Hebrew and Arabic (and almost any character set) to the PDF Invoices, Packing Slips, Delivery Notes & Shipping Label plugin.

The mPDF add-on can also be used with the WebToffee WooCommerce Gift Cards plugin to create gift cards in RTL languages. 

The mPDF add-on can also be used with the WebToffee WooCommerce Request a Quote plugin to create quotes in pdf format. 

== Pre-requisites? ==
